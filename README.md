Programming Languages, Dr. Schwesinger, Spring 2023

This repository contains projects created for Programming Languages, a class required for my major that I took during the Spring 2023 semester. Projects are programmed in JavaScript and OCaml. The instructions for assignments can be found in the READMEs in project folders.
