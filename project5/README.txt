Assignment Instructions:

In this project you will implement algorithms to work with NFAs, DFAs, and regular
expressions. In particular, you will implement an accept function to see whether a string is
matched by a NFA; you will write a nfa_to_dfa function to convert an NFA to a DFA using
the subset construction; and you will write a regex_to_nfa function to convert a regular
expression to an NFA. You will also implement several other helper functions to assist in
these tasks.
The project is broken into three parts: algorithms on NFAs; converting a DFA to an NFA;
and converting/working with Regular Expressions. NFAs and DFAs are implemented in
lib/fa.ml, and regexes in lib/regex.ml
